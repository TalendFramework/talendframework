# TalendFramework
This is a GitHub "fork" of the very useful [TalendFramework](http://talendframework.com/), a collection of templates, maintenance jobs, and routines that accelerate Talend Open Studio development.

The original project was licensed under an [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) (see [note](http://talendframework.com/) on main page). So is [this](LICENSE). In no way am I ([@bmcguirk](https://github.com/bmcguirk)) taking any credit for the great, hard work done by [Alan Black](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alanblack/), [YellowPelican](http://yellowpelican.co.uk/), and rest of the the TalendFramework (TF) team to date. 

# Previous Releases
I don't see a ton of benefit to migrating pre-1.7 versions of TF. I'm open to discussion, though. 

# Roadmap
Alan is working on V1.8 of the Talend Framework right now. We're working out how to best incorporate that with this repository. As we spin this up we will add details on what to expect in 1.8. 

In the coming weeks, we're going to map out some areas we'd like to see improved in the TalendFramework. We'll add them as GitHub projects, etc. as they develop. 

- Support for CI via Maven and CircleCI
- Credential Encryption
- Support for the "InfiniteLoop" component in TemplateProcess, for perpetual jobs
- Better internal Documentation for jobs and components (ideally generating much of the documentation here)
- Migrate documentation from TalendFramework.com to GitHub Pages
- New functionality to assist in setting up ESB jobs, routes, and services
