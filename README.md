# TalendFramework
This is a GitHub "fork" of the very useful [TalendFramework]((http://talendframework.com/), a collection of templates, maintenance jobs, and routines that accelerate Talend Open Studio development.

The original project was licensed under an [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) (see [note](http://talendframework.com/) on main page). So is [this](LICENSE). In no way am I ([@bmcguirk](https://github.com/bmcguirk)) taking any credit for the great, hard work done by [Alan Black](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alanblack/), [YellowPelican](http://yellowpelican.co.uk/), and rest of the the TalendFramework (TF) team to date. 

# Previous Releases
I don't see a ton of benefit to migrating pre-1.7 versions of TF. I'm open to discussion, though. 

# Roadmap
In the coming weeks, I'm going to map out some areas I'd like to see improved in the TalendFramework. Off the top of my head:

- Support for CI
- Credential Encryption
- Support for the "InfiniteLoop" component
- Better internal Documentation for jobs and components (ideally generating much of the documentation here)
- Migrate documentation from TalendFramework.com to GitHub Pages
- New functionality to assist in setting up ESB jobs, routes, and services.

# Contributing
Pull Requests are welcome. Particularly if you are [Alan Black](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alanblack/), whom I cannot find on GitHub.
